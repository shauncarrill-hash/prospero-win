# The PC's Wine for installing games (tools/pw_install.py): the revision the
# title runs (WINE_COMMIT in build_wine_ps5.sh) with the same patch series,
# built for the desktop, so installers open their windows on the PC and the
# prefixes they write are ones the console reads as is. The PS5-only parts of
# the series are compiled only for the console (__PROSPERO__,
# WINE_PS5_USER_DRIVER).
#
# WoW64 (i386 and x86_64 PE modules, 64-bit Unix side), with X11, FreeType,
# fontconfig, Vulkan (DXVK on the PC), PulseAudio/ALSA and GnuTLS, whichever
# the PC has. It is installed under WORK/install and stripped, as Wine's
# distribution packages are: wineboot copies the PE modules into each prefix,
# about 300 MB stripped against 1.5 GB with debug information.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/build_host_wine.sh [--source DIR] [--work DIR] [--jobs N]
# prints the installed wine's path last. --source is a checkout of Wine that
# has WINE_COMMIT (default .deps/wine/source, as build_wine_ps5.sh).
